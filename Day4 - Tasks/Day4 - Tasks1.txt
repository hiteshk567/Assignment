1. Differene between window, screen and document in js?
--> window: The window object is supported by all browsers. It basically represents the browser window.
            Anything which is declared globally automatically becomes members of window object.
            Variables become properties where function becomes method of the window object;
            for eg:
                    var name = "hitesh";
                    console.log(window.name); //hitesh
            Window object represents the current browsing context. It holds things like window.history, window.location.
    
    document: It represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point to the web content, which is
                the DOM tree. Whenever a HTML element is loaded on the web page, it becomes a document object.
                We can access the elements using document object
                for eg: document.getElementById("").

    screen: This bacsically holds information about the physical screen dimensions. It can be used to display the size, height
            width of the screen. For eg: screen.height, screen.width.
